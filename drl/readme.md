# IBM Business Automation - IBM Decision Manager Open Editions - Kogito DRL Decision Service

This repository module contains a Kogito-based decision service, written in [**Drools Rule Language (DRL)**](https://docs.drools.org/8.28.0.Beta/drools-docs/docs-website/drools/language-reference/index.html).  

## Tool & Environment Requirements

The following tools and frameworks are required to be installed on the developer workstation.  Please follow the link in order to download and install the various tools:

1. [**Maven**](https://maven.apache.org) - Required in order to perform Maven builds on the desktop.  
2. [**Git Client**](https://git-scm.com) - Required in order to clone and make changes to the project GIT repositories
3. [**JDK 11**](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) - Requires Java 11 at this time
4. [**GraalVM (Optional)**](https://www.graalvm.org//) - Required if you want to test NATIVE compilation and deployment
5. [**VS Code IDE**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - An IDE is required, VS Code IDE is the default.  While you can use any IDE you wish, the embeddable editors are only available for VS Code.

*_Once you have installed VS Code, you can go to the Extensions Marketplace and install the `Kogito Bundle` for BPMN, DMN, and Test Scenarios_*.

## How To Build

This repository can be built by using `mvn clean install` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  This repository builds all included sub-modules.  The Maven `install` goal places the packaged JAR file into the local Maven `~/.M2/repository`.  The Maven `deploy` goal places the packaged JAR file into the enterprise Maven repository *(ie: Artifactory)*.  

## How To Run 

This decision service is implemented as a Quarkus micro-service and as such can be tested locally by simply running the following Maven command:  `mvn compile quarkus:dev`, which starts Quarkus in `DEV` mode on your local machine.  

## How To Test

There are multiple ways to test this decision service, since the generated interface is a domain specific REST API.  Included in this repository is a set of Postman tests, which you can find the postman directory of this repository.

**Note**: To run a unit test, provided all depencencies are available to the decision service via Maven, simply perform: `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false`.  If you wish to have unit test execution on by default, change the property in the decision service's pom.xml to default the `skipTests` property to `false` _(true is the default)_.

## Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using [**IBM Decision Manager Open Editions**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe) products, which in turn rely on various open source tools and technology. The following online documentation is available in order to learn various aspects of these tools:

- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a projectâ€™s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/
- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io) Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.
- [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org) Kogito is designed from ground up to run at scale on cloud infrastructure. If you think about business automation think about the cloud as this is where your business logic lives these days. By taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
- [**Drools Rule Language (DRL)**](https://docs.drools.org/8.28.0.Beta/drools-docs/docs-website/drools/language-reference/index.html) Drools Rule Language (DRL) is a notation established by the Drools open source business automation project for defining and describing business rules. You define DRL rules in .drl text files. A DRL file can contain one or more rules that define at a minimum the rule conditions (when) and actions (then).
- [**IBM Decision Manager Open Editions**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe) which consists of `IBM Process Automation Manager` and `IBM Decision Manager Open Edition`, offer developers the ability to build cloud-native applications that automate business operations. `IBM Process Automation Manager Open Edition` is a platform for developing containerized microservices and applications that automate processes and business decisions. `IBM Decision Manager Open Edition`, a subset of `IBM Process Automation Manager Open Edition`, is a separately available platform for developing containerized microservices and applications that automate business decisions, including complex event processing.
